If you stream on Twitch with a single monitor, you've probably dealt with this: you're in the middle of a game, chat is active, and you have no idea what anyone is saying. Alt-tabbing kills the vibe and makes you look distracted on stream.

This app puts your Twitch chat directly on screen as a transparent overlay that floats on top of your game. Click-through mode means you can keep playing without the overlay getting in the way.

Built for macOS. Works with any game running in fullscreen windowed/borderless mode.

## Download

Grab the latest `.dmg` from the [Releases](../../releases) page.

### First launch

Since this app isn't signed with an Apple Developer certificate, macOS will block it the first time you try to open it. You'll see something like *"Overlay can't be opened because Apple cannot check it for malicious software."*

To fix this, right-click (or Control-click) the app and select **Open**, then click **Open** again in the dialog. You only need to do this once.

If that doesn't work, open Terminal and run:
```bash
xattr -cr /Applications/Overlay.app
```

## What it does

- Displays Twitch chat in a floating window that stays on top of games
- Transparent glassmorphic background (Apple-style blur effect)
- Click-through mode so you can interact with your game (toggle with Ctrl+§)
- Minimal chat style strips away the Twitch UI, leaving just usernames and messages
- Adjustable text size (small/medium/large) and opacity controls
- Remembers window position between sessions
- Menu bar icon for quick access

## Setup

1. Go to your Twitch channel, click the chat settings gear, select "Popout Chat"
2. Copy the URL (looks like `https://www.twitch.tv/popout/yourchannel/chat`)
3. Open Overlay settings, paste the URL, click Apply

That's it.

## Controls

| Action | How |
|--------|-----|
| Move window | Drag the bar at the top |
| Resize | Drag edges/corners |
| Toggle click-through | Ctrl+§ |
| Settings | Cmd+, or menu bar icon |

## Game compatibility

Works with games running in fullscreen windowed or borderless mode:

WoW, League, Valorant, FFXIV, CS2, Dota 2, Overwatch 2, Diablo IV, Path of Exile, and basically any modern game with a borderless option.

Doesn't work with true exclusive fullscreen (the game takes over the display completely and overlays can't show).

## Troubleshooting

**Overlay not showing in game** — Make sure your game is set to fullscreen windowed or borderless, not exclusive fullscreen.

**Hotkey not working** — Go to System Settings → Privacy & Security → Accessibility and enable Overlay. Restart the app.

**Chat not loading** — Double-check your URL is a valid Twitch popout chat link.

**Window disappeared** — Use Settings → Reset Window Position.

## Built with

## Made by

I built this because I needed it for my own streams. If you want to see it in action or just hang out, come say hi at [twitch.tv/miikkislive](https://twitch.tv/miikkislive).
